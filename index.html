            <h2>Life Expectancy</h2>
            <p>Life expectancy at birth is a crucial indicator of a nation's overall health and socio-economic
                development.
                The visualisation below tracks life expectancy trends from 2000 to 2022, offering a comparison of
                Australia (light blue) with other OECD countries,
                including the US, UK, Germany, Japan, and France. The data presented is derived from the OECD Health
                Status Dataset,
                which forms the foundation for all the insights into long-term population health.

                <p>In the visualisation above, each coloured line represents a different country. As you trace each
                    line, you can observe major changes in each nation over time.<br>
                    To enhance your experience, click any of the year markers on each country's line to see major events
                    for that specific country. This will allow for a deeper understanding of life expectancy over
                    time.<br>
                    One event that had a major effect on overall life expectancy across all countries in the OECD
                    dataset was the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019-2020, where the data clearly shows a drop in all countries
                    except for Australia.

            <h2>What is the leading Cause of Death in Australia?</h2>
            <p>Understanding the primary causes of death in Australia provides insights into health challenges and
                public health priorities.
                This bar chart illustrates the trends in the leading categories of mortality in Australia spanning from
                2000 to 2022.
                The data has been selected from the OECD Health Status dataset and categorised into "Other", "External
                Sources", "Mental Health", "Neoplasms", and "Diseases".

                <p>The categories in the above chart group a large amount of different broad causes of death.<br>

                    The coloured segments represent the number of deaths attributed to that specific broad cause
                    category. These are high-level groupings;
                    for instance, 'Diseases' would encompass a range of different illnesses such as COVID-19,
                    while 'External Sources' would include various non-illness related causes such as assault related
                    deaths or car accidents. <br>

                    The project's documentation indicates these were categorised to group data for clearer insights. You

                    this is intentionally represented to reflect missing data for some Australian records in that year
                    due to differences in data classification

            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                <h3>Comparisons to OECD Countries:</h3>
                <p>
                    Visual analysis of Australian life expectancy compared to nations such as the US, UK, Germany, Japan and France indicate that Australia maintains a 
                    high life expectancy.   
                </p>

                <h3>Changes over time:</h3>
                <p>
                    Over the past two decades, Australian life expectancy has demonstrated a consistent uptrend. This suggests ongoing improvement in overall population 
                    health. However, there have been periods of downturn such as the years preceding the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2022 as shown in the Life Expectancy trends.
                </p>

                <h3>Leading Causes of Death</h3>
                <p>
                    Neoplasms (Cancers) and Diseases (such as cardiovascular, respiratory, and other systematic conditions) have constituted to most death in Australia. 
                    ‘External sources’, ‘Mental Health’, and ‘Other’ causes have contributed a smaller but notable portion of overall mortality.

                <h3>Avoidable Death Trends in Australia (2006-2022)</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Trends</strong><br>
                    The number of total avoidable deaths (preventable and treatable) in Australia rose from 33,191 in 2006 to 40,451 in 2022 and represents a 21.87% 
                    increase.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Context with population growth</strong><br>
                    According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, over a similar period (30 June 2006 to 30 June 2022), Australian population grew from approximately 20.61m to 25.98m which was an increase of 
                    26.08%. Since the percentage increase of total avoidable deaths (21.87%) was slightly less then the overall population percentage increase, it suggests that the rate of total avoidable deaths 
                    may have slightly decreased proportionally during this timeframe.<br>
                    <p><strong>Component Trends</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Preventable Deaths:</strong><br>
                            The number of preventable deaths increased from 21,039 in 2006 to 27,672 in 2022 (31.53% rise). This percentage is notably higher than the population growth at 26.08% in a 
                            similar period, suggesting that there was an increase in the rate of preventable deaths during this period.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Treatable Deaths:</strong><br>
                            This category made up 12,152 in 2006 to 12,779 in 2022 (5.16% rise). This increase was lower than the population growth rate of 26.08% and indicates that there has been a 
                            decrease in the rate of treatable deaths proportionally.

            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                While Australia has a high life expectancy, as shown by the previous visualisations, continued improvements over the last two decades have resulted in positive overall health outcomes.<br>
                <br>
                Australian mortality rates are predominantly shaped by chronic conditions, such as cancers and other diseases, as these are the leading causes of death. 
                This outlines an important need for continued research and preventive treatment.<br>
                <br>
                Trends in avoidable deaths present a mixed picture. The decrease in the rate of treatable deaths is a positive sign; however, the increase in the rate of preventable deaths 
                underscores a continuing need for improvement in public health strategies and interventions.<br>
                <br>
                Overall, the visualised data provides valuable insights for understanding long-term health trends. Our goal was to provide a benchmark for a broad user base to further understand the 
                importance of these statistics and the need for continued improvement in this area.
