                - How does the average life expectancy in Australia compare to other major countries?<br>
                - What are the leading causes of death in Australia?<br>
                - How has life expectancy changed over time?<br><br>
                Through these visualisations, we hope to present a large, complex dataset in a readable and engaging

            <h2>Life Expectancy</h2>
            <p>Life expectancy at birth is a crucial indicator of a nation's overall health and socio-economic
                development.
                The visualisation below tracks life expectancy trends from 2000 to 2022, offering a comparison of
                Australia (light blue) with other OECD countries,
                including the US, UK, Germany, Japan, and France. The data presented is derived from the OECD Health
                Status Dataset,
                which forms the foundation for all the insights into long-term population health.

                <p>In the visualisation above, each coloured line represents a different country. As you trace each
                    line, you can observe major changes in each nation over time.<br>
                    To enhance your experience, click any of the year markers on each country's line to see major events
                    for that specific country. This will allow for a deeper understanding of life expectancy over
                    time.<br>
                    One event that had a major effect on overall life expectancy across all countries in the OECD
                    dataset was the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019-2020, where the data clearly shows a drop in all countries
                    except for Australia.

            <h2>What is the leading Cause of Death in Australia?</h2>
            <p>Understanding the primary causes of death in Australia provides insights into health challenges and
                public health priorities.
                This bar chart illustrates the trends in the leading categories of mortality in Australia spanning from
                2000 to 2022.
                The data has been selected from the OECD Health Status dataset and categorised into "Other", "External
                Sources", "Mental Health", "Neoplasms", and "Diseases".

            <div class="content-wrapper">
                <p>The categories in the above chart group a large amount of different broad causes of death.<br>
                    <br>
                    The coloured segments represent the number of deaths attributed to that specific broad cause
                    category. These are high-level groupings;
                    for instance, 'Diseases' would encompass a range of different illnesses such as COVID-19,
                    while 'External Sources' would include various non-illness related causes such as assault related
                    deaths or car accidents. <br>
                    <br>
                    The project's documentation indicates these were categorised to group data for clearer insights. You
                    will notice a data gap for 2005;
                    this is intentionally represented to reflect missing data for some Australian records in that year
                    due to differences in data classification
                    standards (specifically the ICD-10 not being fully utilised then).

            <h2>How many of those deaths that occured were avoidable?</h2>
            <p>Avoidable deaths are a critical measure of a healthcare system's effectivenes sand the impact of public
                health care.
                These are the deaths that could have been averted through timely and effective healthcare interventions.
                <br>
                The data has been seperated into Treatable and Preventable mortality in order to categorise these types
                of mortality

            <div class="content-wrapper">
                <p> An observable trend in the data shows that both treatable and preventable mortality in Australia
                    increased between 2006 and 2022.
                    Specifically, treatable deaths rose from 12,152 in 2006 to 12,779 in 2022, while preventable deaths
                    increased from 21,039 in 2006 to 27,672 in 2022. <br>
                    <br>
                    While the population growth from 2006 until 2022 in australia approximately 26.08% the total
                    avoidable deaths growth in the same time period grew by 21.87%.
                    This means that there was a slowler overall growth of preventable deaths by population.
